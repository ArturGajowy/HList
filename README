Code for the paper "Strongly typed heterogeneous collections"

We provide the code as shown in the paper for the reader's
convenience. We have minimised this distribution to focus on the
issues discussed in the paper. In the future, there is likely to be an
elaborated distribution of the HList library, or a corresponding
contribution to the Haskell libraries project. The code from the
database section is not included since doing so would have implied
inclusion of substantial packages, namely the underlying
infrastructure for database access library.

The code works --- within the limits exercised in the source files ---
for both GHC (6.2) and Hugs (Nov 2003). See the Makefile for ways of
running test cases.
