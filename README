The HList library and samples

This distribution covers all issues discussed in the HList paper. The
code from the database section of the HList paper is not included
since doing so would have implied inclusion of substantial packages,
namely the underlying infrastructure for database access library. We
think of an elaborated distribution of the HList library, or a
corresponding contribution to the Haskell libraries project.

The code works --- within the limits exercised in the source files ---
for both GHC (6.4) and Hugs (Nov 2003). See the Makefile for ways of
running test cases.
