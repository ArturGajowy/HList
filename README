The HList library and samples

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting the code

> darcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/HList

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pushing changes

You need an account at darcs.haskell.org

> cd HList
> darcs pull user@darcs.haskell.org:/srv/darcs/HList
> darcs record
> darcs push

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution covers all essential issues discussed in the HList paper.
Additional examples and HList operations are provided.
The code from the database section of the HList paper is not included
since doing so would have implied inclusion of substantial packages,
namely the underlying infrastructure for database access library.

You can get HList from Hackage or from Darcs:

$ darcs get --partial http://darcs.haskell.org/HList/

The code works --- within the limits exercised in the source files ---
for both GHC (6.4) and Hugs (Nov 2003). See the 
examples/Makefile for ways of running test cases.

One may run "cd examples; make test" to check the distribution.

See ChangeLog for updates.
