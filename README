The HList library and samples

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting the code

> git clone https://bitbucket.org/HList/hlist HList

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pushing changes

You need an account at bitbucket.org

> cd HList
> git clone git@bitbucket.org:HList/hlist.git
> git pull
> git commit --interactive
> git push

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This distribution covers all essential issues discussed in the HList paper,
though the implementation has been adapted to ghc features implemented
after the paper's writing.

Additional examples and HList operations are provided.
The code from the database section of the HList paper is not included
since doing so would have implied inclusion of substantial packages,
namely the underlying infrastructure for database access library.

You can get HList from Hackage or from bitbucket:

$ cabal update && cabal install HList

Or:

$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/HList/hlist HList
$ cd HList; cabal install

The code works --- within the limits exercised in the source files ---
for GHC-7.6, 7.8, 7.10, 8.2 and 8.4.0.20180209.
Older compilers are not supported.

One may run "cabal test" to check the distribution.

See ChangeLog for updates.
