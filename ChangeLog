	Adam Vogt's patch greatly simplifying makeLabels.

15 Nov 2012
	Ported basic Records.

31 Oct 2012
	New file HList/HList.hs contains the implementation of
	heterogeneous lists. HListPrelude.hs defines operations
	that work across all heterogeneous collections (lists, TIP,
	Records, etc).
	General clean-up, removing obsolete code.
	Code re-written up to Records.

25 Oct 2012
	hUnfold
	hProjectByHNats and hProjectAwayByHNats now take type-level
	list of naturals as the argument. They are implemented in terms
	of Unfold. More computation is made purely type-level.

24 Oct 2012
	Nat, Bool and [*] kinds
	HList is now GADT
	Rewriting FakePrelude, HListPrelude, HArray using type families
	to a large extent, and getting rid of functional dependencies


12 Oct 2011
	Getting rid of overlapping instances in HOccurs
	Using only one TypeEq. This is the only place with overlapping instances
	Using ~ operator instead of TypeCast. Deprecating TypeCast
	Rearrangements of code, removing obsolete code
	Making sure everything works under GHC 7.0.4


19 May 2010
	Beautification, release and tag 0.2.3 by Adam Vogt

26 April 2010
	Patches from Adam Vogt to format documentation for Haddoc and
	to expose MakeLabels
	Release 0.2.1 by Gwern Branwen

29 March 2010
	examples/TIPTransformM.hs, the monadic version of
	TIPTransform.hs

17 February 2010
	Two patches from Adam Vogt to get the code compile on ghc-6.12
	and to make Record Typeable instances nonstrict

10-14 January 2010
        Reverse parameter order for .@.
	Changed fixity <++
	Pushed uses of LANGUAGE pragmas further for OOHaskell examples

16 September 2009
	Added TypeCastGeneric3, TypeEqGeneric3 -- the instances of
	typeCast and TypeEq that don't require separate compilation.
	They are like TypeCastGeneric2, TypeEqGeneric2, but integrated
	with the FakePrelude.
	Added the example file TIPTransform.hs, a variation on the
	keyword argument problem posed by Andrew U. Frank.
	Adjusted the LANGUAGE pragmas, made the examples run without
	the global -fglasgow-exts

15 September 2009
	Release 0.2 by Gwern Branwen

11 August 2009
	Made the regression tests run again.
	Please do "cd examples; make test-ghc"
	after any changes.
	
11 August 2009
	Applied a patch from Justin Bailey:
	Updated fixity declarations for record operators for
	usability and to better match familiar list and 
	arithmetic operators.
	Added Haddock comments for these operators

1 July 2009
	Applied a set of four patches by Brian Bloniarz:
	Improve error messages from Record functions using the Fail
	type class trick
	Add hRearrange, to permute a Record by labels
	Expose a few hidden modules, needed for HaskellDB
	Make hMap, hMapOut & recordLabels maximally lazy
	Add recordValues, analogous to recordLabels
	
29 June 2008
	Apply the set of patches by gwern0@gmail.com: moving a few
	files around, cleaning up hlist.cabal
	
3 February 2008
	Fifteen patches by gwern0@gmail.com: Data.HList hierarchy,
	use of LANGUAGE, -Wall, changes to Cabal files
	
19 September 2007
	Added HMemberM
	Optimized record projection in Record.hs. The optimization
	should be especially noticeable for record narrowing.
	Added NarrowM, which reports both success and failure of narrowing
	Added equivR, record equivalence modulo field order, with
	witnessing conversions
	ConsUnion.hs now checks for record types and treat the latter
	equivalent modulo the order of fields. This gives optimized,
	shallower unions.
	
13 September 2007
	Added UnionSymRec, the symmetric union of two records. The code
	is not very optimal though.
  
12 September 2007
	Added MakeLabels -- Template Haskell code for automatically
	generating Labels (as in Label4.hs).
	Renaming of (data) types in Records, to more meaningful names.
	
05 September 2007
	Added ConsUnion.hs -- building homogeneous lists of heterogeneous
	components by constructing the union on-the-fly.
	
12 February 2007
	Added patches by Einar Karttunen:
	Move files to subdirectories
	Add Cabal infrastructure and HList.hs
	Make it compile with GHC 6.6
	
31 October 2006
	Added HSequence.hs: (monadic) `sequence' for heterogeneous lists.
	It is also the illustration of TypeCast.
	
26 October 2006
	Added CHList.hs: Potentially infinite, open, statically
	constrained HLists.
	
30 August 2006
	Record.hs: Labels now are exclusively type-level entities with no
	run-time representation. The Record API remains the same (although
	the implementation had to be adjusted).
	
31 July	2006
	TAG Release-2.0. The HList DARCS repository announced.
	
22 June	2006
	VariantP.hs: Our extensible (variant) list supports the regular
	list API.
	
20 June	2006
	Added VariantP.hs -- polymorphic variants as dual of records.
	The extensibility problem solved? We can re-use as much as old
	code as possible, when extending the variant and extending
	the functions to the extended variant (and get the subtyping for
	free).
	
19 June	2006
	Added RecordP.hs -- records with unzipped and fully phantom
	labels. Added tests as well.
	
08 May	2006
	MainPatternMatch.hs -- example of pattern-matching on HList's
	Records
	
08 February 2006
	Primed hMap/HMap as to enable a new native definition
	Started ChangeLog, finally.
