ChangeLog finally started 08 February 2006

20 June     2006
	Added VariantP.hs -- polymorphic variants as dual of records.
	The extenbsibility problem solved? We can re-use as much as old
	code as possible, when extending the variant and extending
	the functions to the extended variant (and get the subtyping for
	free).
	
	
19 June     2006
	Added RecordP.hs -- records with unzipped and fully phantom
	labels. Added tests as well.
	
08 May      2006
	MainPatternMatch.hs -- example of pattern-matching on HList's
	Records
08 February 2006
	Primed hMap/HMap as to enable a new native definition
