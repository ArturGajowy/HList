	Fifteen patches by gwern0@gmail.com: Data.HList hierarchy,
	use of LANGUAGE, -Wall, changes to Cabal files
	
19 September 2007
	Added HMemberM
	Optimized record projection in Record.hs. The optimization
	should be especially noticeable for record narrowing.
	Added NarrowM, which reports both success and failure of narrowing
	Added equivR, record equivalence modulo field order, with
	witnessing conversions
	ConsUnion.hs now checks for record types and treat the latter
	equivalent modulo the order of fields. This gives optimized,
	shallower unions.
	
13 September 2007
	Added UnionSymRec, the symmetric union of two records. The code
	is not very optimal though.
  
12 September 2007
	Added MakeLabels -- Template Haskell code for automatically
	generating Labels (as in Label4.hs).
	Renaming of (data) types in Records, to more meaningful names.
	
05 September 2007
	Added ConsUnion.hs -- building homogeneous lists of heterogeneous
	components by constructing the union on-the-fly.
	
12 February 2007
	Added patches by Einar Karttunen:
	Move files to subdirectories
	Add Cabal infrastructure and HList.hs
	Make it compile with GHC 6.6
	
31 October 2006
	Added HSequence.hs: (monadic) `sequence' for heterogeneous lists.
	It is also the illustration of TypeCast.
	
26 October 2006
	Added CHList.hs: Potentially infinite, open, statically
	constrained HLists.
	
30 August 2006
	Record.hs: Labels now are exclusively type-level entities with no
	run-time representation. The Record API remains the same (although
	the implementation had to be adjusted).
	
31 July	2006
	TAG Release-2.0. The HList DARCS repository announced.
	
22 June	2006
	VariantP.hs: Our extensible (variant) list supports the regular
	list API.
	
20 June	2006
	Added VariantP.hs -- polymorphic variants as dual of records.
	The extensibility problem solved? We can re-use as much as old
	code as possible, when extending the variant and extending
	the functions to the extended variant (and get the subtyping for
	free).
	
19 June	2006
	Added RecordP.hs -- records with unzipped and fully phantom
	labels. Added tests as well.
	
08 May	2006
	MainPatternMatch.hs -- example of pattern-matching on HList's
	Records
	
08 February 2006
	Primed hMap/HMap as to enable a new native definition
	Started ChangeLog, finally.
